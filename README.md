## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

A Single Page application built with TypeScript (React) that allows users to search GitHub usernames, and get some data about the profile. The application lets users share their custom URL with others so that they can quickly view and access all of the repos.

Why not use GitHub? Well you can, but this site is designed to be shared like a portfolio, meaning it is simplistic, and removes all of the distracting features.
